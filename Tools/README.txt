I have removed the .git and .gitignore folder/file from LicenseGenerator-iOS so I get it into the repo. I could have put this folder in the Cocoapods for the app, but I'm only using the script in the build process, not using the code of the repo itself in the running app. I'll have go back to this archive from time to time and see if there are updates to the generator.
