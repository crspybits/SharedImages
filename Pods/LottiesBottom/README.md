## Description

Uses https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios animations for a pull up from the bottom control for a UIScrollView. E.g., this is useful for a pull-up-from the bottom refresh control for a UITableView. And could just be a fun easter egg too! The Lottie animation .json file you use needs to be in the main bundle of your app.
