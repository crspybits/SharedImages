		Added new tab for Settings because of this too.
		I've relocated the image deletion functionality to the "Action" button too because a long-press now selects images to get ready for the "Action operaton.
	
	* Reconsider spinners
		Moved rotating black & white spinner up to right of Action button (on the upper left)
