		https://github.com/crspybits/SharedImages/issues/157

Version 0.25.0 (1/5/19)
	* Added progress indicator for Albums screen
	* Updates from client library.
	* Fixed bug from v0.24.0-- delegate for SyncServer client wasn't setup early enough in launch sequence which caused a crash in some flows through the app-- e.g., when installing the app for the first time and signing in.

Version 0.24.0 (12/30/18)
	* Update with fixes from client shared library.
	* Fixed: Problems with sync or sticky sign in?
		https://github.com/crspybits/SharedImages/issues/139

	* Error handling for "gone" files and for corrupted/changed files from server.
		https://github.com/crspybits/SharedImages/issues/143

Version 0.20.0 (10/13/18)
	* Now have multi-album support for users, with server version 0.17.4.
	* Migration from sharing group id's to sharing group UUID's.
	* Badge for app now reflects the number of sharing groups that need updating, not the number of files that need downloading (it's inefficient to keep up the previous metric).
	
Version 0.19.0 (7/28/18)
	* Updates for sharing group ids and server version 0.16.3 -- owning users now storing data into their own cloud storage.
	* Migration: 
		- Need to sign the users out-- this should reupload people's tokens to get them into the database.
		- Need to add sharingGroupId to image and discussion Core Data objects.

		https://github.com/crspybits/SharedImages/issues/117
	* Added badge to images tab to give total number of unread comments.
	* Reset unread counts: Badges not cleared on images screen
		https://github.com/crspybits/SharedImages/issues/113
	* Fixed: LottiesBottom-- still leaves some bits after refresh
		https://github.com/crspybits/SharedImages/issues/91
	* Added more positive indication that a sync has started, and completed--
		And didn't find anything to download. (When it downloads, there is a clear
		positive indication of that already).
	* Dany: Sync error
		https://github.com/crspybits/SharedImages/issues/89
		(There was not enough info to fix, but improved logging and alerts)
	* Lots of "Synchronization error"s.
		https://github.com/crspybits/SharedImages/issues/105
		I added in a minimum time interval of 60s between error reports to the UI from the SyncServer client.
	* Added check for cellular data connection
		https://github.com/crspybits/SharedImages/issues/106
	* Various issues with bottom LottiesBottom refresh
		https://github.com/crspybits/SharedImages/issues/121
		a) LottiesBottom appears on screens other than the Images tab.
		c) N sticks around
	* Numerous network (?) issues
		https://github.com/crspybits/SharedImages/issues/120
		I had been trying an experiment to *not* check for a lack of a network connection prior to making server calls. It seems that's not a very good way to go-- I think these errors are arising most due to that. I'm going to stop this experiment and use a different means to detect the lack of a network connection prior to making server calls.

Version 0.15.0
	* Now using fileGroupUUID's-- new image/discussions are now linked using this method.
	* Deal with https://github.com/crspybits/SharedImages/issues/77
	* Use completion handler on logAllTracking() to ensure flushing of output.
	* Don't resolve download deletion/appMetaData upload conflicts by keeping upload-- this is now disallowed by client interface.
	* Added migration-- to add fileGroupUUID to Image's.
	
Version 0.14.2 (5/3/18)

Version 0.12.0 (2/12/18)
	* Adding discussion thread feature.
		https://github.com/crspybits/SharedImages/issues/75
		As part of this:
		- Using MessageKit Cocoapod for UI for discussion threads
