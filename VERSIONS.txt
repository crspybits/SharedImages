Version 0.7; 8/12/17
	* Clear badge after downloading images
		https://github.com/crspybits/SharedImages/issues/13
		
	* Move ODRefreshControl to a fork
		https://github.com/crspybits/SharedImages/issues/4
		
	* Narrow images.
		https://github.com/crspybits/SharedImages/issues/6
		
	* Share image in other ways
		https://github.com/crspybits/SharedImages/issues/17
		Added new tab for Settings because of this too.
		I've relocated the image deletion functionality to the "Action" button too because a long-press now selects images to get ready for the "Action operaton.
	
	* Reconsider spinners
		Moved rotating black & white spinner up to right of Action button (on the upper left)
		because with new Settings tab, we can no longer have a spinner in the middle of the tab bar.
