Version 0.12.0 (2/12/18)
	* Adding discussion thread feature.
		https://github.com/crspybits/SharedImages/issues/75
		As part of this:
		- Using MessageKit Cocoapod for UI for discussion threads
		- Presenting this UI in a modal
		- Requiring minimum server version so I don't corrupt the existing production server
		- Using badges on image in UI to indicate unread discussion messages.
		- Utilizing syncServerUserId, user display name, and user initials in MessageKit
		- Updated terminology in upload/download progress indicator
		- Added a close icon
		- JSON discussion files also include image uuid's so that given only user data, discussions might be reconnected to their images.
