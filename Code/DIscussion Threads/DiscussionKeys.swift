    // 4/17/18; For some early files, image titles were stored in appMetaData. After server version 0.14.0, they are stored in "discussion" files. While the image title is stored in the "discussion" file-- that's for purposes of upload and download. Normally, we access the image title from the Core Data Image object title property.
