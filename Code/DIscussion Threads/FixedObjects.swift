Provides upport for a special type of file to reduce conflicts with SyncServer:

- JSON format
- Top level structure is an array of JSON dict objects
- Each of these objects has a unique id
- Once added, these objects *never* change
- Once added, these objects cannot be removed
- New objects can be added, with their unique id
- Objects are simply ordered-- in the order added; e.g., first added is first.

So, in terms of SyncServer and conflicts, resolving a conflict between a file download and a file upload for the same file will amount to ignoring the file download and ignoring the current file upload, but creating a new file upload containing all of the objects across upload and download. Those will be easily identified due to their unique id's. We won't have to worry about resolving conflicts within any object because they can't change.
