# SharedImages

Eventually, SharedImages will be on the Apple app store. The backend ([SyncServerII](https://github.com/crspybits/SyncServerII/)) isn't quite there yet though. If you want an early look at this app, please contact the developer (chris@SpasticMuffin.biz) for TestFlight access.

If you want to go it alone, and boot up your own ([SyncServerII](https://github.com/crspybits/SyncServerII/) instance, you can do that yourself too. [See the instructions here for that](https://crspybits.github.io/SyncServerII/).
