## Main Features

### Private & self-owned social media

Users store their images in their own cloud storage (Dropbox or Google Drive), and safely share those images with invited others. Facebook users can be invited.

### Private discussion threads per image

Conversations about the images are also stored in user cloud storage. And users that can access the images can access the discussion threads.
